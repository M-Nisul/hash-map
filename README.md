Hash Map Database Project.

This repository contains a hashmap data structure which has the following functions,

hash(key): Takes a key as an argument and returns the hash code of that key.

set(key, value): Takes two arguments one is the key and the other is the value assigned to the key. Add the key, and value pair to the hashmap (if the key already exists the old value will be overwritten).

get(key): Takes a key as an argument and checks if the passed key is present in the hashmap and returns the value assigned to the key if yes or returns `null` if not.

has(key): Takes a key as an argument and checks if the passed key is present in the hashmap. If yes, return `true` if not return `false`.

remove(key): Remove the passed key from the hashmap.

length(): Returns the length of the hashmap.

clear(): Removes all the entries in the hashmap.

keys(): Returns an array containing all the keys in the hashmap.

values(): Returns an array containing all the values in the hashmap.

entries(): Returns an array containing all the key, and value pairs in the hashmap. Ex: [[firstKey, firstValue], [secondKey, secondValue]].
